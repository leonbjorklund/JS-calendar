// Get todos from local storage
// Get all from current month

// Store to some kind of variable

// Check variable for a todo from the current date during day square creation

// Show number of todos found

// Should update when a todo is added.
// Todos will have to be mapped to the calendar separately from it's rendering.
// Todos rendering can then be called again with each addition or removal of a todo.
// Perhaps only call the function if the addition or removal happens on the current openMonth to avoid unnecessary work.
